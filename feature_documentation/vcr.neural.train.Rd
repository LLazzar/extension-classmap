\title{
Prepare for visualization of a classification made by a custom algorithm on training data.
}
\description{
Produces output for the purpose of constructing graphical displays such as the silplot and quasi-residual plot. The user first needs train its classfier of choice on the training set. Then here the predicted posteriors probability on the training set are used along with the true labels. If a distToClass matrix is provided, the function calculates 'farness', needed to construct classmap plot.
}

\usage{
vcr.custom.train(y, probs, distToClass=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{

\item{y}{factor with the given/true class labels of the objects.}
\item{probs}{Matrix cointaining the posterior probabilities obtained on the considered training set by the trained classifier. Each row represents the set of posterior probabilities for a certain observation for the different classes, that are represented in the columns. The order of the observations in the rows must match the same order used in \code{y}. The classes in the columns must be in the same order as the levels of \code{y}. The posteriors probabilities should be consistent with the fact that the classifier assign the observation to the class for which the posterior probability is higher and permit PAC computation. Each row should add up to 1.}
\item{distToclass}{Matrix containing the distances of each observation to each possible class. The user should produce this matrix using a custom-devised metric that is coherent with how the trained classifier works and sees the data. The ordering for rows and columns in \code{probs}. This input allows the computation of the farness value for each observation and enables the \code{classmap} plot.}

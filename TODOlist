if posteriors are feeded as dataframe? in new data is converted to matirx in vcr.train?
does X input as input is needed at all? RENMOVING X ONLY DOUBT IF DIMENSIOND D IN COMPUTEFARNESS AFFINE WITH TESTADATA=true
search for neural in funciton and adjust
vcr.custom.train not required in custom.newdata if you don't want to compute farness
fix this   d <- vcr.custom.train.out$figparams$ncolX #it has to be fixed! (it come out in test.R where vcr.custom.train.out has figparams null)  (mayybe add check only if computing farnes)

polish function


DEBUG
feed y not factors, should give error.
feed null distToclasses
feed incorrected dist to class (for ex in dimensions)
test quasi residual plot (with farness NULL)
test farness
try to feed to both functions distTovclass or newdistclass with wrong dim

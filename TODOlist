if posteriors are feeded as dataframe?
does X input as input is needed at all?
search for neural in funciton and adjust
vcr.custom.train not required in custom.newdata if you don't want to compute farness
fix this   d <- vcr.custom.train.out$figparams$ncolX #it has to be fixed! (it come out in test.R where vcr.custom.train.out has figparams null)  (mayybe add check only if computing farnes)


DEBUG
feed y not factors, should give error.
feed null distToclasses
feed incorrected dist to class (for ex in dimensions)
test quasi residual plot (with farness NULL)
test farness

polish documentation
understand why indetiify function is off??
make vignettes
add factor with order same of feede to algorithm (like in description of y vcr.neural.train) it is crucial if for exampel comes from python where factor do not exist
CHECK COMPRFARNESS TYPE KNN, WHAT DIFFERS FROM AFFINE?? (knn is used in r√®part where we get fig)

DEBUG
feed y not factors, should give error. OK gives error
feed null distToclasses
feed incorrected dist to class (for ex in dimensions)
test quasi residual plot (with farness NULL)
test farness
try to feed to both functions distTovclass or newdistclass with wrong dim
use quasi residual plot


IN THE PACKAGE BUILD POHASE
check import namespace

### MDScolorscape ###################################################################

- option to show legend or not
- make input of function richer?? FOR NOW IT'S OKAY
- make documentation


-when hover tell also wich is ypred LONG MAYBE LAST
-add tsne umap or other dim reduction? IT WOULD MEAN TO GO OUTSIDE MDS
-for test add trasparency in backgorund the training, would imply redoing dissimilarity matrix together etc.  TOO LONG
-adjust fact of indsv, in mds i can keep also observation with na values in y and na pac and plot them black REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME; MAYBE AS LAST LAST THING

DEBUG
feed matrix with wrong dimensions DEBUGGED
try to feed vcr out test with a class that is not present in the predictions
feed with vcrout that has strings in factors

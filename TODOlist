polish documentation
understand why indetiify function is off??
make vignettes
add factor with order same of feede to algorithm (like in description of y vcr.neural.train) it is crucial if for exampel comes from python where factor do not exist
CHECK COMPRFARNESS TYPE KNN, WHAT DIFFERS FROM AFFINE?? (knn is used in r√®part where we get fig)

DEBUG
feed y not factors, should give error. OK gives error
feed null distToclasses
feed incorrected dist to class (for ex in dimensions)
test quasi residual plot (with farness NULL)
test farness
try to feed to both functions distTovclass or newdistclass with wrong dim
use quasi residual plot


IN THE PACKAGE BUILD POHASE
check import namespace

polish and comment VCR_plotly
adjust fact of indsv, in mds i can keep also observation with na values in y and na pac and plot them black
checks, like dissimilarity matrix how big
putting zoom feature? or xlim ylim on the graph
make input richer! size of points , stroke and other things
for test add trasparency in backgorund the training, would imply redoing dissimilarity matrix together etc maybe tpoo long
maybe change colors, silplot rainbow funciton assign not so good color for the scope, violet and red are the only good, darkcolor are best as I tried with feeding personalized classcols like darkblue darkgreen etc,

add tsne umap or other dim reduction?

DEBUG
feed matrix with wrong dimensions
try to feed vcr out test with a class that is not present in the predictions
feed with vcrout that has strings in factors

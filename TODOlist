understand why indetiify function is off??
make vignettes
add factor with order same of feede to algorithm (like in description of y vcr.neural.train) it is crucial if for exampel comes from python where factor do not exist

DEBUG
feed y not factors, should give error. OK gives error
feed null distToclasses
feed incorrected dist to class (for ex in dimensions)
test quasi residual plot (with farness NULL)
test farness
try to feed to both functions distTovclass or newdistclass with wrong dim
use quasi residual plot


IN THE PACKAGE BUILD POHASE
check import namespace

###MDScolorscape


adjust fact of indsv, in mds i can keep also observaiton with na values in y and na pac and plot them black
checks, like dissimilarity matrix how big
putting zoom feature?
make input richer! size of points , stroke and other things

DEBUG
feed matrix with wrong dimensions
try to feed vcr out test with a class that is not present in the predictions
feed with vcrout that has strings in factors

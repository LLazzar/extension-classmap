  # Arguments:

  #                   data. Missing values are not allowed.
  #   y             : factor with the given class labels of the objects.
  #                   Make sure that the levels are in the same order as
  #                   used by the training algorithm.
  #   probs         : set of posteriors probabilities that the trained model produce
  #                   on the training set, either naturally or derived in some way by the user for its algorithm
  #                   The columns of probs must be in the same order as the levels of y.
  #                   This posteriors should be consisent with the fact that classifier
  #                   obsject to class with higher posterior (NBNB).
  #   distToClasses : set of distances of each training observation to all possible class in
  #                 : the eye of the trained algorithm, defined by user, it allows computation 
  #                 : of farness for each observaiton and thus of the classmap plot

  #   y         : given labels
  #   levels    : levels of y
  #   predint   : predicted class number. For each case this
  #               is the class with the highest probability,
  #               that is, which.max(probs[i,]).
  #   pred      : predicted label of each object.
  #   altint    : alternative class as integer, i.e. the non-given
  #               class number with the highest mixture density.
  #   altlab    : alternative class of each object.
  #   classMS   : list with center and covariance matrix of each class
  #   PAC       : probability of alternative class for each object
  #   PCAfits   : if not NULL, PCA fits to each class, estimated from
  #               the training data but also useful for new data.
  #   figparams : parameters for computing fig, can be used for
  #               new data.
  #   fig       : distance of each object i from each class g.
  #   farness   : farness of each object to its given class.
